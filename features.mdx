## Real-time Video Content Scanning

Shomri uses AI to analyze video frames as they stream, blocking inappropriate content without buffering delays.

### How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant S as Shomri Filter
    participant AI as AI Scanner
    U->>S: Play Video
    S->>AI: Analyze Frames
    AI-->>S: Safe/Blocked
    alt Safe
        S->>U: Stream Video
    else Blocked
        S->>U: Block Page
    end
```

<Expandable title="Advanced Scanning Options" default-open="false">
  Customize sensitivity levels:
  
  | Level | Description | Use Case |
  |-------|-------------|----------|
  | Light | Basic keyword detection | Everyday browsing |
  | Medium | Frame analysis + audio | Family devices |
  | Strict | Full AI deep scan | High protection |
</Expandable>

## Handling Access Requests Remotely

When a block occurs, users can request access, which you approve from any device.

<ParamField path="request_id" param-type="string" required="true">
  Unique ID for the request.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="reason" param-type="string" required="false">
  User's explanation for access.
</ParamField>

Example approval via dashboard API:

<CodeGroup tabs="cURL,JavaScript">
````bash
curl -X POST https://api.shomri.com/v1/requests/{request_id}/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"reason": "approved"}'
````

````javascript
const response = await fetch(`https://api.shomri.com/v1/requests/${requestId}/approve`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ reason: 'approved' })
});
````
</CodeGroup>
