  Authoritative architectural rules governing backend/frontend responsibilities,
  Convex usage, data flow, type safety, and agent behavior. This document
  overrides feature-level and implementation documentation.

### This project consists of:

#### Backend

Convex database with queries, mutations, and actions

#### Frontend

Multiple independently deployed React projects, each hosted on its own domain

### Convex Documentation

Primary reference: <a href="https://docs.convex.dev/llms.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https\://docs.convex.dev/llms.txt</a>

This LLM-optimized documentation should be your first stop for any Convex-related questions or implementation details.

### Core Principle: Thin Frontend, Smart Backend

Most business logic must be handled by the backend. The frontend should mainly be responsible for:

- UI state (modals, dropdowns, form inputs, selection states)

- Presentation logic (formatting for display, conditional rendering)

- Calling backend queries, actions, and mutations

### Frontend Guidelines

#### Data Fetching

- Use useQuery, useMutation, and useAction hooks to call Convex functions

- Pass user input directly to Convex functions without processing

- Let the backend handle validation, transformation, and business logic

#### Pagination

- Reference: <a href="https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https\://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination.md</a>

- Default to 20 items per page

- NEVER load more than 50 items at a time

### React Patterns to Avoid

- Treat useEffect, useMemo, and data transformations with suspicion

- These often indicate logic that belongs in the backend

- When in doubt, ask Eliezer Jacobs before implementing

#### Data Processing Anti-Patterns

- Iterating over an entire table/array to find an entry is a code smell

- This likely means the frontend is doing work the backend should handle

- The backend can use indexes and queries to fetch data efficiently

### Type Safety

- Convex generates a typed api.ts file listing ALL available endpoints

- Always rely on these generated types

- NEVER use type casting or as assertions with Convex types

- If types don't match, the issue is likely in the backend definition

# Escalation Rule

If any of these guidelines need to be violated, consult with Eliezer Jacobs first.
